## About
- NGS-based molecular detection for diagnostics and research (WES, WGS, targeted panels).
- Bench-to-bioinformatics: assay design → data generation → analysis → interpretation.
- Recent focus: portable, reproducible workflows and HPC/SLURM scale.

## Skills
- Wet lab: qPCR, PCR, library prep, Illumina, ONT, MGI, automation
- Bioinformatics: R, Python, Bash, SLURM, metabarcoding, primer design, Geneious, Sequencher
- Tools & platforms: Git/GitHub, Docker, Singularity, Nextflow, n8n
- Web & visualization: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Highlights
- mdZotero — Automates citation workflows between Zotero and R Markdown  
  Impact: Cuts manual bibliography edits; reproducible templates
